# PQSQ-DataApproximators

This is a set of Matlab procedures for performing PQSQ-based data approximation.

In particular,

PQSQmean - computes the mean value with PQSQ approximation error 

pcaPQSQ - computes PCA with PQSQ approximation error 

kmeansPQSQ - computes k-means clustering using PQSQ potential

Simplest examples of use are provided in the comments to the corresponding functions
