# PQSQ-DataApproximators

This is a set of Matlab procedures for performing PQSQ-based data approximation.

In particular,

PQSQmean - computes the mean value with PQSQ approximation error 

pcaPQSQ - computes PCA with PQSQ approximation error 

pcaL1 - computes approximative l1-based PCA

For large data sets, we include wrappers of the PQSQ-based procedures implemented in Java, providing several fold gain in the computational time.
