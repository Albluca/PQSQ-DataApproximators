function norm = PQSQ_Norm_fast( x, potentialFunction, ret )
%Calculate the PQSQ Error for one or more points vector.
%  x is n-by-m matrix with rows which correspond to data points.
%  intervals is m-by-K matrix with K values of thresholds which corresponds
%       to each coordinate. intervals(:,K) MUST be equal to Inf.
%   A and B are matrices of coefficients of quadratic functions
%   ret is type of returned values:
%       0 or omitted means returning the whole matrix of potentials
%       1 means returning the row vector of sums of potentials for each
%           coordinate
%       2 means returning the column vector of sums of potentials for each
%           data point.
